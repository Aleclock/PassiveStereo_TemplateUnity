# PassiveStereo_TemplateUnity

Unity version: 2020.3.45f

This Unity project consist of a template for stereoscopic rendering on 3D projector. It consists of two main scenes:
1. DemoSceneSimple, simple stereoscopic render of a scene;
2. DemoSceneOperatorPanel, stereoscopic render of a scene and operator display on the third display.

In an empty scene, just add `Player_VirtualWall` prefabs to the scene.

Player movements inside the scene are mapped on the joystick:
* joystick left stick : player movement and locomotion;
* joystick right stick (only horizontal axis): horizontal player rotation;
* R2/L2 : vertical tilt
